Building on design thinking developed\nthrough case studies and critique exercises, the course will also introduce several interface\nimplementation technologies and standards, across a variety of computing modalities and\ncontexts, including desktop, web, mobile, gesture, virtual reality, and multi-touch hardware. Basic knowledge of HTML and Java is assumed. Classes will consist of lectures based on the course readings, relevant videos, and discussions of late-breaking research. Lab sessions will\nreview the data gathering methods, programming techniques, experimental methodologies, and\nalgorithms needed to complete the assignments, as well as allow students time to work with\nspecialized hardware required for some assignments.", "core_for_major": false, "last_taught": "Winter 2014", "instructor": "Dr. Christopher Collins", "url": NaN, "criteria": [{"name": "Assignments:", "weight": 0.3}, {"name": "Midterm:", "weight": 0.2}, {"name": "Final: ", "weight": 0.22}, {"name": "Participation:", "weight": 0.03}, {"name": "Project", "weight": 0.45}], "learning_goals": "Describe a typical process used to understand people and contexts, enumerate tasks and requirements, and to evaluate the success of implemented interfaces.Critique interactive interface design using well-founded theoretical explanations.Recognize the impact of human-computer interaction in everyday life situations.Implement universal design techniques and apply standards for universal accessibility.", "topics": [{"week": "Work in small teams on a multi-step project.", "title": NaN}, {"week": "Write and speak clearly about issues and challenges in hardware and software interface design, specific challenges uncovered during their term project.", "title": NaN}, {"week": "Apply general mathematical models in the assessment of interaction technique efficiency and effectiveness.", "title": NaN}]}, {"name": "CMPT 481/811 \u2013 HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION", "description": "Fundamental theory and practice in the design, implementation, and evaluation of human-computer interfaces.", "core_for_major": false, "last_taught": 2014, "instructor": "Dr. Regan Mandryk", "url": NaN, "criteria": [{"name": "Assignments:", "weight": 0.15}, {"name": "Midterm:", "weight": 0.2}, {"name": "Final: ", "weight": 0.3}, {"name": "Participation:", "weight": 0.05}, {"name": "Project", "weight": 0.3}], "learning_goals": "Practice the skills of ideation, low-fidelity prototyping, and medium-fidelity prototyping.Evaluate the usability of a system through techniques that do not involve the end user (e.g., heuristic evaluation) and those that do involve an end user (e.g., controlled user studies).Iterate on an interface using the results of the evaluation.Implement an interface, using the skills of ideation, prototyping, and evaluation.Present and communicate their interface and evaluation through a project report, project presentation, and project video \u2013 similar to how human-computer interaction research and case studies are presented in the community.", "topics": [{"week": "Introduction, Design Principles, Pathological Designs, The Psychology of Everyday Things", "title": NaN}, {"week": "GUIs and WIMPs, Design Thinking, Ideation", "title": NaN}, {"week": "Prototyping, Low-fidelity (paper), Medium-fidelity (e.g. Flash, Tcl/tk), High-fidelity (UI Toolkits)", "title": NaN}, {"week": "Evaluating with and without the User, Usability Inspection, Observational Evaluation, Surveys, Interviews, and Focus Groups", "title": NaN}, {"week": "Quantitative Evaluation, Human Processing, Information Processing, Motor Processing, Visual Attention", "title": NaN}, {"week": "Graphic Design Principles, C.R.A.P.
