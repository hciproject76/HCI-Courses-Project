Evaluate the usability of a system through techniques that do not involve the end-user (e.g., heuristic evaluation) and those that do involve an end-user (e.g., controlled user studies). Iterate on an interface using the results of the evaluation. Implement an interface, using the skills of ideation, prototyping, and evaluation. Present and communicate their interface and evaluation through a project report, project presentation, and project video – similar to how human-computer interaction research and case studies are presented in the community.",Assignments:: 0.15;Midterm:: 0.2;Final:: 0.3;Participation:: 0.05;Project: 0.3,"1: Introduction, Design Principles, Pathological Designs, The Psychology of Everyday Things;2: GUI's and WIMP's, Design Thinking, Ideation;3: Prototyping, Low-fidelity (paper), Medium-fidelity (e.g. Flash, Tcl/tk), High-fidelity (UI Toolkits);4: Evaluating with and without the User, Usability Inspection, Observational Evaluation, Surveys, Interviews, and Focus Groups;5: Quantitative Evaluation, Human Processing, Information Processing, Motor Processing, Visual Attention;6: Graphic Design Principles, C.R.A.P.

It is designed for incoming, first semester HCC PhD students. Students from other degree programs are warmly welcome, if they are willing to do significant reading. Email the instructor, Amy Bruckman asb@cc.gatech.edu, for a permit.

This class introduces students to theoretical readings and their successful application to human-centered computing. Much of the reading is challenging. The class is recommended for students with a theoretical bent. Master's students considering a PhD in the future may enjoy this class. If you are an interdisciplinary student mainly seeking out a general introduction to how computing systems for humans are designed, then the class you are looking for is most likely CS 6750, Human-Computer Interaction.

Topics covered include an introduction to a wide range of theories, and their application to the design of interactive computing systems, including:

Sociology of science and technology
Epistemology
Social construction of technology
Category theory
Activity theory
Distributed cognition
Culture
Identity and presentation of self online
Learning
Ubiquitous computing

Wherever possible, we try to pair a theoretical reading with an application of that theory to human-centered computing. The application papers are not necessarily foundational to the field, but are good examples of the use of theories and illustrate theory's relevance.",Participation: 0.1;Reading Reflextions: 0.3;Elevator Pitches: 0.2;Research Proposal: 0.2,1: Welcome & Overview;2: Examples of Strong HCC Research;3: Sociology of Science and Epistemology of Knowledge;4: Social Shaping of Technology;5: Politics and Technology; Category Theory;6: Culture;7: Distributed Cognition;8: Activity Theory;9: Artificial Intelligence;10: The Social;11: Learning;12: Legitmate Peripheral Participation;13: Ubiquitous Computing;14: Discussion of Proposals;15: No class--Happy Thanksgiving!
